    <ul>
      <li class="blockquote">
        Having previously used mainly React.js for front-end development, I was
        excited to see Vue.js in the project requirements. Most of the time was
        spent on figuring out the ins and outs of the framework. I enjoyed
        working with Vue quite a lot, and hope to learn more about its ecosystem
      </li>
      <li class="blockquote">
        Because I wanted to minimize the amount of pop-up windows and keep the
        SPA-like navigation without integrating a state management library, I
        chose to persist search results to local storage and ease data retrevial
        during back and forth navigation between different Views
      </li>
      <li class="blockquote">
        Initially I planned to implement an autocomplete feature to the Form's
        input fields for improved UX but in the end chose not to do so, as I
        didn't find a quick and easy way to dynamically access the relevant
        data, i.e. a list of all countries or a list of all settlements â€“
        getting an
        <code>"Error: lookup in table 'list_asustusyksus' not possible"</code>
        when tryin to query list_countries and list_asustusyksus tables. But
        apart from that, the Django REST API was easy and enjoyable to work with
